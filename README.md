# FMI Layered Standard for XCP (FMI-LS-XCP)

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp/actions/workflows/build-ls-xcp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp/actions/workflows/build-ls-xcp.yml)

This repository contains a current prototype draft for the FMI Layered
Standard for XCP (FMI-LS-XCP) based on the
[Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI] 3.0 standard for the exchange of
simulation models. Note that this draft is being worked on actively,
and thus is subject to change without notice.

This is currently not normative, nor is this document to be considered
officially endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved
organisations prior to official adoption.

The [FMI Layered Standard for XCP (FMI-LS-XCP)][spec] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubspec] and is published [here][spec]. It is based on
the [FMI][] standard.

## News

Dive into our latest video ["FMI, Layered Standards and ASAM Standards - Enabling Seamless SiL Simulation of Virtual ECUs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzzKRa3jORs).
Discover how the cutting-edge FMI 3.0 standard and the layered standards based on it are revolutionizing the world of Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) simulations.

During the presentation the three new layered standards for simulating virtual ECUs with FMI 3.0 are introduced:

- FMI-LS-XCP for measurement & calibration with XCP
- FMI-LS-BUS for simulation of network communication with CAN, CAN FD CAN XL, FlexRay, Ethernet, LIN
- FMI-LS-STRUCT for structured entities like lookup tables

After this a demo from different SiL tool vendors (Akkodis, Altair, AVL, Bosch, dSPACE, PMSF, SYNOPSYS) illustrates the interoperability of these layered standards.

## Other FMI Layered Standards

If you are interested in the FMI Layered Standard for XCP, the [FMI-LS-BUS] could also be relevant to you.
The [FMI-LS-BUS] specifies an FMI extension for using network communication (e.g. CAN, Ethernet, LIN, FlexRay) within FMUs.
