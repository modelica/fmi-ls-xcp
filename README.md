This repository contains a current prototype draft for the FMI Layered
Standard XCP (fmi-ls-xcp) based on the 
[Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI] 3.0 standard for the exchange of
simulation models. Note that this draft is being worked on actively,
and thus is subject to change without notice.

This is currently not normative, nor is this document to be considered
officially endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved
organisations prior to official adoption.

The [FMI 3.0 Layered Standard XCP][spec] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubspec] and is published [here][spec]. It is based on
the [FMI][] standard.
